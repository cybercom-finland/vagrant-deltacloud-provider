      An unknow error happened in Vagrant Deltacloud provider

      To easily debug what happened, we recommend to set the environment
      variable VAGRANT_DELTACLOUD_LOG to debug

          $ export VAGRANT_DELTACLOUD_LOG=debug

      If doing this does not help fixing your issue, there may be a bug
      in the provider. Please submit an issue on Github at
      https://github.com/cybercom-finland/vagrant-deltacloud-provider
      with the stracktrace and the logs.

      We are looking for feedback, so feel free to ask questions or
      describe features you would like to see in this provider.

      Warning! The Deltacloud provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.
    warn_network_identifier_is_assumed_to_be_an_id: |-
      As Neutron endpoint is not available, the identifier '%{network}' is assumed to be an id (not a name).
    warn_volume_identifier_is_assumed_to_be_an_id: |-
      As Cinder endpoint is not available, the identifier '%{volume}' is assumed to be an id (not a name).

      instance_not_found: |-
        Vagrant was unable to find the Deltacloud instance used for your vagrant machine.
        This can happen when the instance has been deleted via Deltacloud APIs or Deltacloud
        Dashboard instead of using vagrant commands.
        We recommend using the command `vagrant deltacloud reset` to reset
        vagrant to a clear state
      nerwork_service_unavailable: |-
        Neutron service endpoint is not available, thus there is not way to retrieve
        network id from its name. You have to provide only ids in your Vagrantfile.
      volume_service_unavailable: |-
        Cinder service endpoint is not available, thus there is not way to retrieve
        volume id from its name. You have to provide only ids in your Vagrantfile.
      server_status_error: |-
        Server '%{server}' is in error status.

    states:
      short_active: |-
        active
      long_active: |-
        The server is up and running. Run `vagrant ssh` to access it.
      short_build: |-
        building
      long_build: |-
        The server is currently being built. You must wait for this to
        complete before you can access it. You can delete the server, however,
        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error
      long_error: |-
        The server is in an erroneous state. Contact your Deltacloud administrator
        or destroy the machine with `vagrant destroy`.
      short_hard_reboot: |-
        hard reboot
      long_hard_reboot: |-
        The server is hard rebooting. This is equivalent to pulling the power plug
        on a physical server, plugging it back in, and rebooting it.
      short_password: |-
        password reset
      long_password: |-
        The password is being reset on the server.
      short_reboot: |-
        reboot
      long_reboot: |-
        The server is in a soft reboot state. A reboot command was passed to the operating system.
      short_rebuild: |-
        rebuild
      long_rebuild: |-
        The server is currently being rebuilt from an image.
      short_rescue: |-
        rescue
      long_rescue: |-
        The server is in rescue mode.
      short_resize: |-
        resize
      long_resize: |-
         Server is performing the differential copy of data that changed during
         its initial copy. Server is down for this stage.
      short_revert_resize: |-
        revert resize
      long_revert_resize: |-
        The resize or migration of a server failed for some reason. The destination
        server is being cleaned up and the original source server is restarting.
      short_shutoff: |-
        shutoff
      long_shutoff: |-
        The virtual machine (VM) was powered down by the user, but not through the
        Deltacloud Compute API. For example, the user issued a shutdown -h command
        from within the server instance. If the Deltacloud Compute manager detects
        that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server instance to the
        SHUTOFF status. If you use the Deltacloud Compute API to restart the instance,
        the instance might be deleted first, depending on the value in the
        shutdown_terminate database field on the Instance model.
      short_suspended: |-
        suspended
      long_suspended: |-
        The server is suspended, either by request or necessity. This status appears

      short_unknown: |-
        unknown
      long_unknown: |-
        The state of the server is unknown. Contact your cloud provider.
      short_verify_resize: |-

      short_not_created: |-
        not created
      long_not_created: |-
        The server is not created. Run `vagrant up` to create it.
